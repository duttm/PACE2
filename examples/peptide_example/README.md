# PACE2 Peptide Example

This example consists of the peptide assembly system consisting of two Candidates. The system runs on localhost and each candidate is set to use 4 cores. At the current time, the analysis CNN code is not a part of this repository, since it is being developed and maintained in a separate repository. However, it will be added shortly. Access to that repository can be granted upon request.

In the interim, this example uses the `force_outcome.py` method (see `examples/dummy_example` directory) to demonstrate the extension and elimination capabilities of the framework. 

## Running the peptide example

`pace2.py simconfig_local.json resconfig_local.json`
